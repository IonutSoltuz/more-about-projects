# More About My Projects

Below are some of the projects I’ve worked on over the past 2 years.

## 2025 - Present

### TmodLauncher Mods
I’m creating a modified version of the game *Terraria*, using my own knowledge of C# and custom sprites drawn in GIMP.

## 2025

### Autoclicker
I developed a small autoclicker for personal use in C#. It can perform left or right clicks in any external application, at a frequency of 1 ms (which can be adjusted).

## 2024 - Present

### Drone
Together with a colleague, I successfully designed a drone using various components (e.g., Arduino board, RC car battery, tri-phase motors, a 3D-printed custom frame designed by us,
and many soldered connections). Last semester, I took a course on real-time microcontroller programming, which helped us enhance the drone.
Currently, we are working on replacing the amateur-grade components with more professional ones.

## 2024 - Present

### TPS Game in Unity
I participated in a summer school program at my university focused on game development in Unity, called 3DUPB2024.
I studied the Unity environment, level design logic, and GPU concepts.
The program concluded with the presentation of a 3D game prototype I developed individually, which I can continue developing on my own.

## 2024

### Anomaly Detection Algorithm for Object Classification
I designed, in Python, an algorithm that receives a few thousand low-resolution, pixelated black-and-white "images" for training,
and then classifies a smaller set of images (still in the thousands) as objects (e.g., t-shirt, shoe) with an accuracy of 91%.
This project was part of a university course, and my result was ranked in the top 10 among approximately 80 students.

## 2024

### Database with Graphical Interface
I created an SQL database for tracking patients with special treatments, for which I also built a graphical user interface with a login section using C#.

## 2024

### Participation in ZebraHack Hackathon
I developed a web page using HTML, CSS, and JS.

## 2023

### Web Application
I coded a web page about a video game using HTML, CSS, and JS, incorporating various interactive elements for my personal learning.

## 2023

### Decryption and Enhancement of an “Image”
I wrote a C program that reads a Notepad document literally written in Chinese and converts it into text containing three-digit numbers representing grayscale shades in PGM image format.
After decryption, the program applies a clarity enhancement phase using a median filter with a user-selected radius.
The PGM image was intentionally corrupted with “stray pixels” to highlight the effects of different filter radii.
